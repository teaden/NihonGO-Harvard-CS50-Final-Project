# NihonGO-Harvard-CS50-Final-Project
Web Application with Rudimentary Translation Functionality Between Japanese and English

NihonGO is a web application made with Flask. The application takes an inputted string, splits the string into individual 
words (if translating from English) or characters (if translating from Japanese), finds the associated text in the requested language, 
and then rebuilds the string in the requested language. NihonGo finds the matching text in the requested language by using a Japanese -
English dictionary that was stored in a SQLite database. The program incorporates Python, JavaScript, HTML / CSS, and SQL. This code 
served as my final project in Harvard's CS50 course, which I took during the Spring 2019 semester.

For additional information regarding design decisions made as well as how to use the application, please see the md_files folder.
